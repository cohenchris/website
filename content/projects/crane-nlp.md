During the summer of 2019, I had the pleasure of working for the
Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division. I improved US Navy
missile sustainment efforts by upgrading an existing natural
language processing algorithm to process failure databases. The
work that I contributed to has a patent pending as well.
