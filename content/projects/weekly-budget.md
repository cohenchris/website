## Forking WalletCount
For this project, I forked [WalletCount](https://github.com/GittyMac/WalletCount)
I wanted a simple budgeting app that suited my needs. Personally, I give myself a set budget
each week. If I go over the budget for the week, the next week's budget is lessened. If I
stay under, the available funds are carried over for the next week. This project was the
closest to what I wanted (a minimalist, slim budgeting app). The core functionality had to
be changed for my purposes, though, so I set out to do it.

## Ideology
If you set your weekly spending budget to $100, $100 would be added to your
available funds. Every time that you make a purchase, you subtract that
amount from your available funds. Every Sunday, another $100 would be added into
your available funds.

The intent of this app is to help the user keep track of their "fun-money", or money left
over after all necessary expenses have been paid. My philosophy is that, once you
have paid all fixed expenses, the money left over should be completely guilt-free.
To encourage this view, past purchases are purposefully omitted. I designed this for
my purposes specifically, but I hope that somebody else will find it useful!
