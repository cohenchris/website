## Intro
When I took delivery of my motorcycle in August 2022, the seller started it in front of me, which was a great sign. He claimed that the bike, which had last been registered in 1994, had not been stored with any gasoline in it, which was great to hear (it was a lie). Modern gasoline contains about 10% ethanol, which increases the octane rating. However, it also comes with an unfortunate side effect - at less than one month, shelf life is abysmal. Once ethanol gasoline starts to spoil, it starts to clog the microscopic holes in the carburetor jets, causing a myriad of issues. Modern fuel injection started to appear in the 1980s, with the last carbureted car being made in 1994, and the last carbureted motorcycles being made into the 2010s. Fuel injection is a fantastic innovation - it is essentially immune to gasoline spoilage. The pressure at which these injectors spray can dislodge blockages, and so, you never have to worry about old gas.

*Carburetors are a nightmare with modern gasoline* - any classic vehicle owner knows. Ethanol-based gasoline is already expensive in California, averaging over $6/gallon at the time of this post. Ethanol-free fuel is available, but incredibly difficult to find. In fact, there are zero ethanol-free gas stations anywhere near San Diego. The only alternative is to buy ethanol-free fuel by the gallon at Home Depot, which runs at **over $20/gallon!** I refused to pay that.

While I was learning, maybe I should have bitten the bullet.

## How Carburetors Work
Anyways, I should start at the beginning. From the shop manual, here is the diagram of these carburetors:

A bit overwhelming, to say the least. These are incredibly complicated, precise pieces of equipment. If you don't put them together exactly right, it doesn't run. If any of the fragile, soft brass jets are scratched, it will run terribly. If any of the jet holes are a little bit clogged, it will run terribly. I spent hours watching YouTube videos on carburetors, and became fascinated. I highly recommend watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toVfvRhWbj8) video from SmarterEveryDay, and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRNfyz1Cgvg) video from FortNine. 

## Restoration

At first, the carburetors looked like this:

The choke handle was loose, it was rusty all over, and I couldn't get the bike to show any signs of life. Luckily, my mechanic did motorcycle work on the side. I brought them to him, and ended up paying $350 for a full restoration. When I went to pick it up, he told me it was a miracle that the bike started in the first place. He had to soak it in SeaFoam to soften the residue, and only then, he was able to get to work. Jets were inspected, float level was inspected, seals were refreshed, screws were tightened up, and everything was surgically cleaned.

## First Start

Here they are after being cleaned:

TODO

Externally, not much different. I went home, put them on the bike, and shockingly, it fired right up. This was probably the best feeling of this entire restoration. What was not year clear to me - every single piece of rubber on this motorcycle needed replacing. Simply put, rubber is not meant to last. Over time, as it's exposed to UV, heat, wear and tear, and age, the rubber becomes more brittle, and is not as flexible as it once was. These carburetors are suspended between the air box and engine with rubber manifolds, which were absolutely shot.

## A Sign of Difficulties to Come

Luckily, I could source the manifolds from the carburetor to engine quite easily. Unluckily, the manifolds from the air box to carburetor were nearly impossible to find. I ended up paying $60 for two pieces of rubber, shipped directly from Japan. To this day, it's the only place online where they can be bought. 

Unknown to me, this was a huge red flag. Parts for old vehicles can be difficult to find. It all depends on the age and popularity of the vehicle. If you buy an old Honda CB, there will be absolutely no shortage of parts, as they have a cult following. My motorcycle, however, is a bit more obscure. This rubber manifold was my first of many part-sourcing headaches to come.
