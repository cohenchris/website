This group project focused on the SCRUM philosophy of software
development and making a full-fledged application. I was assigned
to the front end team, since I already knew ReactJS, and did an
extremely large majority of the work for the front end. I learned
how to communicate with the back end Python Flask API using
'axios' GET/POST calls, and made a dynamically-updated GUI for the
user. I am most proud of creating a login/logout functionality, as
well as a Direct Messaging system between users. The most
difficult part was updating the GUI based on who is logged in.
