Carburetors are magic.

Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toVfvRhWbj8) from Smarter Every Day, which gives an exceptional breakdown of how carburetors work. He builds his own *transparent* carburetor, and uses a slow-motion camera to capture some incredible detail.

# Cleaning Method

## Overview
First, a look at the parts diagram for these specific carburetors:

There are a *ton* of small, delicate parts here. In order to keep these running at peak efficiency, all of the tiniest passageways must be totally clear of dirt, debris, and buildup. With modern ethanol-based fuel, this is a nightmare.

Ethanol-based fuel became more prominent in the late 20th and early 21st century as a way to address growing environmental concerns. Ethanol is renewable, burns relatively clean, increases the octane rating of whichever fuel it's mixed into, and is significantly cheaper than typical gasoline. Modern fuel contains around 10% ethanol, as a rule of thumb.

With the rise of fuel injection, there are virtually zero downsides to using ethanol-based fuel.

Carburetors, however, are a different story. Ethanol-based fuel has a very short shelf life - around 8 weeks, on average. After this point, it's common for the fuel to gunk up, separate, and clog these tiny carburetor passageways. Fuel stabilizer helps extend this shelf life, but it's not perfect. With this project, there are long periods where I've let the bike sit, so I've had to clean my carburetors many times.

Manually cleaning carburetors is entirely possible, but I would highly recommend the investment into an ultrasonic cleaner. For a few hundred dollars, you'll save hours of your time, get a much deeper clean, and have a fun tool for other projects :)

# Disassembly and Cleaning
## Organization
It's incredibly important to stay organized. Without proper organization, you may lose parts, swap parts, or put the carburetors back together incorrectly. I can speak from personal experience - for a few months, I accidentally swapped 2 of the air jets on one carburetor, and the bike ran terribly.

I like to take a piece of cardboard and divide it up with a sharpie. I'll poke the small parts into the cardboard, lay larger piece on top, and label each piece with the part number from the diagram above.

## Using the Ultrasonic Cleaner
Ultrasonic cleaners are easy to use. I would recommend buying a cleaner that can fit the entire carburetor body, fully submerged.

For the solution, I bought Simple Green concentrate from the hardware store diluting it 1:10. Whichever solution you choose, it's important to ensure that it will not damage rubber or aluminum. After filling up the cleaner, I started with the largest parts - the carburetor body, float bowls, and top caps.

Temperature and time are the only two settings to worry about. After looking around a bit online, I settled on 50C for 15 minutes. Once the solution was pre-heated, I threw the largest parts in.

After these were clean, I took a metal mesh sieve from my kitchen, put all of the tiny pieces in, and repeated the same steps.

It's VERY important to neutralize the parts after use. Without this, depending on your solution, you may see some corrosion on certain pieces. Personally, I rinsed everything in water, then used a can of compressed air to quickly dry.

These carburetors weren't filthy, but it's satisfying to see how much gunk was removed, even after having manually cleaned them 3-4 times prior!

# Final Product
Sparkling clean! For some 47-year-old pieces of metal, these look fantastic.

This is maybe the 5th time I've cleaned these, and the first time I've used an ultrasonic cleaner. Considering I know how to take these apart like the back of my hand, the most time-consuming part was waiting for the solution to heat up. I'm never cleaning these by hand again!
