After finishing most of the mechanical work, I decided to take some time to clean and polish some of the old, worn aluminum. My end goal is to have all of the metal looking like new, but that's going to be an incredibly tedious process. Evidently, the previous owner of this bike either never cleaned it, or ran it through some mud before letting it sit for 30 years. There's an absurd amount of stuck-on gunk on the engine, and scattered surface rust.

This is my first attempt at cleaning some of this up.


# Materials
No need to complicate what's a relatively straightforward process:

1. Electric Drill
2. [Mother's Mag and Aluminum Polish](https://mothers.com/products/mag-and-aluminum-polish-05101)
3. [Harbor Freight Polishing Kit](https://www.harborfreight.com/14-piece-aluminum-polishing-kit-98707.html)
4. [Shoelaces](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08JJ4MH4F/) (to polish spokes, more details later)
5. Aluminum foil
6. Brass bristle brush
7. Some solvent to dissolve hard grime (I used carburetor cleaner)

# Process
## Engine
A first look at how disgusting the engine is:

Whether that's oil, road grime, or mud, I have no idea. What I **do** know - this stuff was rock solid, and took some serious elbow grease to remove. I spent over an *hour* scrubbing with some solvent and a brass brush (yes, I know a metal-bristled brush isn't ideal working on aluminum, but this was a desperate measure).

This is only a start. I ran out of will to sit under this thing for hours, scrubbing and drying out the skin on my hands. With more time, space, and motivation, I eventually plan to remove the grime on this whole engine, then do a bit of polishing. Who knows whether that will happen or not.

## Exhaust
This was, by far, the most satisfying part to polish. It's a very unique, rare 2-to-1 exhaust, and is a huge accent to the bike. Polishing this piece transformed the look of the bike. Before, it was dull and had some tarnish spots. Since this bike is from 1976, the chrome is *real*. Chroming is a very toxic process, so nowadays, the EPA has many restrictions in place around the process. Old chrome is thick and durable - new chrome is thin and fragile. With more room for error, old chrome tends to clean up well. Here's what I was dealing with:

There are a few things to keep in mind when cleaning chrome:
1. Avoid scratches *at all costs*. If you do end up scratching the chrome, and moisture gets into the scratches, there's potential for rust.
    - Use a scrubbing agent which is softer than chrome. For example, rather than using steel wool, use crumpled-up aluminum foil.
2. If the chrome is too far gone, and it's old-style (thick), you *can* polish it with polishing compound. It's highly discouraged to polish new chrome, since you may polish straight through the thin layer that's present.

This chrome was in decent condition, so no need to use polishing compound. I used crumpled up aluminum foil + water, and put in the elbow grease to shine it up.

Very satisfying.

## Turn Signals
Cleaning these up was the second most satisfying part - small parts, quick turnaround, instant results. Since they're also chrome, I followed the same process as the exhaust - crumpled aluminum foil + water.

Here's what I was dealing with:

And here's the finished product!

## Hubs and Spokes
The hubs weren't terrible at first, but the spokes were rough. If I was going to polish the spokes, I figured I may as well polish the hubs.

The hubs were more time-consuming than difficult. After dismounting the wheels and removing the hubs, I used some of the smaller polishing tips to get into tight spaces, then slowly worked my way through each side of each hub. Aside from a few hiccups where I wore through a polishing tip and scratched the hub surfaces, it went relatively smoothly.

Polishing the spokes, however, was a different story. There are 40 individual spokes PER WHEEL. All were tarnished, and almost half of them had some surface rust. I found [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9SJGLDNwqY) video on YouTube, which showed a pretty ingenious method of dipping shoelaces in polishing compound, wrapping it around a spoke, and pulling the lace back and forth to polish. This was extremely effective, but when it takes a minute or two per spoke, you still end up sitting there for over an hour... 

Ideally, I'd completely disassemble the entire wheel and ultrasonically clean all of the metal, which would be easier and more thorough, I did not have this luxury at the time, so this was the best I could do for now.

After hours of tedious work, the work was worth every moment.

# Aftermath
In late 2023, I moved, and no longer had the luxury of keeping my bike protected in a covered, underground garage. Southern California was hit with a few nasty storms, and my bike was parked on the street. Unfortunately, some tarnishing popped up again, so a good portion of the polishing that I did, hubs/spokes especially, was pretty much for nothing. Guess I'll be doing this again in the future...
