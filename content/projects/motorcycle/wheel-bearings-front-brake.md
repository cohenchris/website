# Background
## 45-year-old Bearings
Old wheel bearings were simple - you have the raceway, which is where the ball bearings sit. Then, you have the bearings themselves, which are freely placed in the raceway, secured and lubricated with some generic bearing grease. Since the bearings are exposed, they would eventually wear out due to contaminants mixing in with the grease. In contrast, newer bearings function in the same way, but are sealed units. Since there is no risk of environmental contaminants prematurely wearing the bearings, they have a much longer lifespan.

I could tell that the current bearings were original. While I may have been able to get away with using the old ones, I wanted to play it safe. Fortuntely, bearings are pretty universal, and looking up the original part numbers produced many modern sealed equivalents for the original bearings.

Below, you can see the original part diagrams for the front and rear hubs. I sourced the bearings and seals from each.

## How to Replace Bearings
Wheel bearings and their wheel housings are manufactured with extremely tight tolerances, and secured with a press-fit. Proper installation requires professional press tools, assembly lube, and a precise, straight fit. Since most shops refuse work on old vehicles, I mistakenly decided to try and do this myself.

# Replacing Bearings and Seals

## DIY Attempt
## Autozone Rent-a-Tool
This bearing replacement was a one-time job. With proper care, bearings should last many miles, so from this point onwards, I would just need to clean and re-grease. I didn't want to spend the money on an expensive bearing removal kit, but only use it once. Luckily, many auto parts stores have a rental program, and I found a nice kit at Autozone. You do pay for the kit up front, but as long as you bring it back complete and undamaged, you receive a full refund.

### Zero Progress
After watching a few YouTube videos on how to remove bearings, I went to work. Even though I had a semi-professional bearing removal kit, these things would not budge an inch, no matter how much muscle I put into it. Simply put, I didn't have the leverage or proper space to do this job.

## Professional Work
### Nobody Works on Old Bikes
I accepted that I would have to bring these bearings to a professional for replacement. The issue - for liability reasons, it's incredibly difficult to find a mechanic who will work on an old bike. If something breaks, parts can be limited or impossible to find.

Nevertheless, I called around. After multiple rejections, I finally found a place who agreed to do the work with one stipulation. Again, for liability reasons, they did not want to take the wheels off. For them to replace these bearings, I would need to remove the wheels myself, and bring them in separately.

### No Place to Work
The task itself wasn't too much to ask, but I would need a safe, secure place to work. I didn't know how long they would need to finish the job, and I didn't want to leave my bike propped up on the street with no wheels. Fortunately, through a friend of a friend, I found a temporary garage to work in.

When I replaced the tires, it was the same story. Nobody wanted to remove the wheels, so I had to remove them myself.

I'd only removed the wheels once before, so after some trial and error, I had them off again. I dropped the wheels and bearings off at a local shop and went home.

To my surprise, after just an hour or two, the work was done! I picked up the wheels, then headed back to my friend's garage.

### Old Things Break
As I said, this was one of the first times that I replaced the wheels. So, after hours of work, mistakes, and learning, I'd finally re-attached both. As I was about to ride out for the night, I pressed the front brake. To my surprise, it stuck. The back brake uses an external spring to return the brake back to its initial position, but that wasn't present on the front. I convinced myself that I must have lost the spring. Cue an hour of looking, but no success. After a closer look at the parts diagram, the return spring on the front is internal, so I was looking for a part that didn't exist. Eventually, I figured out that the brake must have been gummed up a combination of years of brake dust buildup and sitting without lubrication. Given that front brakes typically make up about 70% of a motorcycle's braking power, I couldn't exactly ride home without a front brake. I had no choice but to remove the wheels and thoroughly clean the brakes. This didn't exactly excite me, as I was going on 6 hours of constant work.

I ended up cleaning the front brake that night out of necessity, but did the same to the rear brake at a later date.

# Drum Brake Cleaning
## Before
These brakes were disgusting. Pad dust is an unavoidable issue with all types of brakes, whether they're drum or disc. The buildup was serious on these, and I can imaging it was made worse by the age and dryness of the brake pads. There's no easy way to do this - I used a combination of brake cleaner (multiple bottles, by the end) and terry rags to slowly break down and wipe off years of brake dust.

### Fair Warning
NOTE: If you do something like this, *TAKE PROPER PRECAUTION*. Old brake pads contain asbestos, so you should wear appropriate protective gear. As you clean, spray, and agitate this dust, it will go everywhere. At all times, I wore a mask and safety glasses.

## After
I was quite happy with how these cleaned up, given their age. Hours of elbow grease later, I had the assurance that my brakes were working as well as they possibly could.

### Sourcing New Brake Pads
These old KZs have a decent cult following, so I expected there to be some good selection for aftermarket brakes. I had the choice between NOS (new old stock) and reproductions. Normally, I try to use NOS parts to keep this bike period-accurate, but using old brake pads is generally not recommended. The pad material will have inevitably broken down a bit, and safety is much more important than period-accuracy.

I was surprised to learn that the reproduction brake pads *still* had asbestos in them, but I didn't have much of an option. Proper safety gear should be enough to mitigate the risks, and I won't be pulling these apart all the time, so asbestos it is.

### Polishing
After putting in this much work, I decided to make the brakes look a bit nicer. To polish these brakes, I used a drill, a Harbor Freight [drill polishing pad kit](https://www.harborfreight.com/14-piece-aluminum-polishing-kit-98707.html), and tons of [Mother's Mag & Aluminum Polish](https://mothers.com/products/mag-and-aluminum-polish-05101). It was slow going, but incredibly rewarding. With aluminum parts as old as these, it's important to manage expectations. Some blemishes were nearly impossible to get out, and I particularly struggled in tight spaces. Regardless, the idea for this restoration was *not* to make this bike look as if it just rolled off the factory line in 1976, but to learn and do my best. There was a solid learning curve with polishing - I wore through the pads and scratched the brakes, flung polish everywhere, and overall, did far from a professional job. All factors considered, I'm very happy with how these brakes turned out.
