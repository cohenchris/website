# FACS
At the most basic level, an engine needs 4 things to run.
- Fuel
- Air
- Compression
- Spark

In this post, I will explain what these mean, how to check/fix each component, and what I personally did to get my vintage motorcycle running.

## Fuel

This is the touchiest of the 4. In order for your engine to run cleanly, efficiently, and reliably, the fuel system *must* be sealed and spotless. If you have fuel injectors, make sure that the spray pattern is correct, the ECU is stock, and each injector is spraying. Personally, I have no experience with fuel injection, so you will have to Google.

Carburetors, however, are my strong suit. To ensure a properly working careburetor, it's pretty simple. First, ensure that the jets are all stock. Since carburetors are mechanical (rather than electronically controlled, like fuel injectors), they rely on extremely precise measurements to work properly. Motorcycle manufacturers designed the jets to work specifically for your motorcycle, so for optimal performance, you need to keep them stock. In the shop manual, you will be able to find part numbers for each jet. Most times, on the jets themselves, there will be a number which indicates its size. Ensure that these numbers are correct, and the jets are not dirty, clogged, or damaged in any way.

Once your carburetors are clean and stock, we can check the rest of the fuel system. Make sure that your gas tank is spotless, and all gas that you put into your tank is fresh. If you let the gas spoil, or don't fully clean your tank, bits and pieces of varnish or gunk will leak into your carburetor, potentially causing jet passageways to clog.

Finally, your should ensure that the fuel hoses are fresh and undamaged. Auto part stores have bulk fuel hose in stock for cheap. These hoses should be clamped at either end. Fuel systems (no fuel pump) heavily rely on the presence of a vacuum. Without this vacuum, fuel will not properly flow, and you will starve your engine of fuel.

## Air

Air is the easiest part of this entire process. First, check that your air box is undamaged, and your air filter is clean. That's the easy part.

In the previous section, I mentioned that fuel systems rely on a vacuum to function. Over time, rubber degrades, and will eventually cause vacuum leaks. These can be tough to diagnose and fix, so I always err on the cautious side, and replace if in doubt.

## Compression

In my opinion, compression is the most nerve-wracking of these 4 points. Bad cylinder compression can indicate internal engine damage, which can lead to a rough time for your bank account. Most engines need at least 80 psi of compression to run at all. To test this, you have 2 options.

- Finger test
- Compression testing tool

The finger test is my preferred method. If I have some internal engine damage, I don't want to know :D.
To perform a finger test, stop the flow of fuel, and disconnect both spark plug leads. Take one spark plug out, and place your finger over the cylinder hole. As your crank your engine (kickstart or electric start), your finger should get pushed off of the hole. As a general rule of thumb, if your finger comes off of the hole, you likely have enough compression to start. Do this with all cylinders.

If you want a more precise measurement, most auto parts stores have compression testers for rent. Follow your specific tool's instructions, but the general process is to disconnect spark plug leads, unscrew one plug, and crank the engine until the max compression is reached. Make note of the value and cylinder number, and perform this test on all cylinders. In your shop manual, there will be a target range for compression.

## Spark

Spark can go a few ways. Either you have spark, or you don't.

If you don't have spark, you could be missing something simple, or you could have a nightmarish electrical gremlin waiting for you. Good luck.

To perform a simple spark test, stop the flow of fuel and disconnect one spark plug. You should ground the spark plug on something, like the engine body. As you crank your engine, watch for a spark between the electrodes. If you see a spark, that plug has passed the test. Check all plugs.

## Conclusion

If you've passed all of these tests, you can be quite confident that your vehicle will run. If not, it could be due to other underlying issues, like timing. Consult your shop manual to diagnose further.
