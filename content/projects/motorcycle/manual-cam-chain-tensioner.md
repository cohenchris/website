# Background
For the most part, Japanese motorcycles from the 70s are notoriously bulletproof.
My bike has over 23,000 miles on the clock, which is high for most bikes.
These bikes, however, can easily go to 100k with proper care.

There is one single exception with this model - the stock cam chain tensioner.
Cam chains can be found in nearly every engine, and their sole purpose is to keep important moving components in time with one another.
Typically, components whose timing is important will have a gear attached.
Components will first be adjusted to their proper positions, then kept in sync by attaching a chain to these gears.
Any slippage or jumping of this chain will have potentially catastrophic results.
At best, your engine won't start.
At worst, valves will hit pistons and shatter.

To secure this chain, a chain tensioner is used.
This tensioning system usually consists of two parts - a plastic guide, and a metal tensioning rod.
The tensioning rod dictates how much tension the chain is under, and the guide will disperse the force of that rod over a larger surface area on the chain.

As the engine wears, chains stretch, and the tension of the chain will need to be adjusted.
Kawasaki decided to implement a semi-automatic tensioning system in these bikes, pictured below:

The spring-loaded portion on the right will be pressed against the aforementioned plastic guide.
As the chain moves more quickly, it will be under more tension.
This spring-loaded system is designed to provide varying tension depending on the speed of the chain.
Chain moves faster - more pressure against the spring, less tension.
Chain moves more slowly - less pressure against the spring, more tension.
Additionally, as the spring becomes more compressed from age, you can adjust the tensioner to compensate.
Eventually, the spring (and possibly chain) will need to be replaced due to wear, but most owners will not need to do this.

This all sounds really nice in theory, but in practice, there is one flaw.
Imagine you're riding down the highway, throttle wide open.
You see brake lights ahead of you, and abruptly close the throttle to begin braking.
In the upper RPMs, there will be more pressure against the spring, and it provides less tension on the guide.
When you close the throttle, the chain will be moving slower, but the spring may have not caught up yet.
It is possible that a dangerous amount of slack will be left in the chain, so it could jump a tooth.
In the worst-case-scenario, your bike's engine is now scrap metal.

# The Simple Solution
There's a pretty established discussion and aftermarket community for old bikes like these.
Reddit and [KZRider](https://kzrider.com) are my two favorites.

This semi-automatic tensioner is a very common issue with bikes around this time period (not necessarily Kawasaki!).
For most popular bikes (Honda CB-series especially), there is some guy out there on the internet who mills and sells alternative tensioners for this exact use case.

These alternative tensioners are completely manual - essentially, it's just a single screw.
Need more tension? Tighten the screw.
Need less tension? Loosen the screw.
It doesn't get much simpler than that.

There is some room for error, of course... if it's not tightened enough, it may jump timing.
If it's too tight, the chain may stretch excessively or break.
While this solution requires some manual intervention and maintenance by the rider, rule-of-thumb being once every oil change, it's much more reliable than the semi-automatic version.

This all sounds great! I did some reading to understand how all of this works, and started searching for somebody selling a manual tensioner for my model.

## Scouring Every Corner of the Internet
I searched for *days*.
These are so popular that tensioners for some models are sold on major retail websites!
Not ONE of these major sites carried one for my bike.
Nobody on Reddit was selling any.
I couldn't even find any mention of anybody doing this on old bike forums (for my exact model).

After a tiring search, I found exactly one lead.
An old, early-2000s-looking, [HTTP-only website](http://clems-garage.com/CCT) for some guy named Clem based out of Ohio, last updated in 2012.
The home page says,
> This product was developed out of my need to replace broken/failing cam chain tensioners on my own bikes.  It became apparent very quickly that I wasn't alone.  Many other riders could benefit from these and I developed a cost effective method of manufacture to make them at a good price for others to keep their motorcycles properly running. 

> I currently have designs for most Kawasaki motorcycles, several Honda models, along with some Yamaha and Suzuki models.

> If you need one for your bike, fill out the information form or use my email address below and I will send you information and a quote, plus answer any questions you may have.

Looked mildly promising, but again, the website was last updated in 2012.
I emailed him anyways.
To my surprise, he responded! We chatted back and forth for a bit, and he confirmed that he did have a manual tensioner for my model!

> I do have a tensioner made for them. I made a few, but never got one on a bike. The rider I was working with found out his engine wasn't the stock 400 and didn't complete the purchase. If you want to work with me take a good picture of the tensioner and send it to me, I want to know if it is the one I made or if it is a different one. I also bought up every KZ400 gasket I could get, I think I have 40 of them.

Ok... so he has some made, but has never sold one for this model.
What I'm hearing is that, if this works out, my bike is going to be truly one of one :D
Judging off of his website, he clearly knows what he's doing.
He has links and photos for numerous models that have been successfully installed.
Really, though, I had no other option, so I decided to give it a shot.

## Installation
After a week or two of waiting, the tensioner arrived.
It came with the plate which will attach to the body of the bike, and two different lengths of tensioning screw.
Since he had never had one of these installed, he wasn't positive if the typical shorter screw would be long enough.

Instructions were well-written and straightforward. To paraphrase:

1. Remove the existing semi-automatic tensioner by unscrewing the two connecting bolts.
2. On the new tensioner, back out the adjustment bolt fully.
3. Bolt on the new tensioner, torquing to spec.
4. Turn in the adjustment bolt as far as possible by hand.
5. Carefully, rotate the crank shaft clockwise, which will pull the cam chain taut on the drive side, making the tensioner slack. At the same time, turn in the adjustment bolt to take up this slack.
6. Perform step #5 for a few revolutions, taking up any slack you find.
7. Back off the adjustment bolt by 1/4 - 2/3 turns (2 flats of the acorn nut).
8. Tighten down the locknut to secure the adjustment bolt.

Installation was a bit nerve-wracking for a first-timer, but went without a hitch.
Even better, the engine sounded exactly the same, which means that it worked!
Since I was his first customer for this model, he graciously offered to give me a $10 refund if I would take a good photo after installation, which of course I did.

Looks pretty out of place on this old bike, but it's a small price to pay for peace of mind.

After removing the old tensioner, I was curious at how much it had worn.
I had a replacement spring on hand. Let's just say that getting rid of this was for the best... this amount of compression might look minimal, but it's pretty significant, considering the semi-automatic tensioner could only be adjusted by a few millimeters.

My experience with Clem's Garage was exceptional.
The man I talked to, Mark, was very knowledgeable, informative, and generally wanted to see this work out for both of us.
If you're looking for a manual cam chain tensioner, I can wholeheartedly endorse these guys!
