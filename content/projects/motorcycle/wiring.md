When I took delivery of my bike in August 2022, I did the two easiest things - changed the air filter and replaced the battery. One of these went very smoothly, the other turned into a weeks-long endeavor and demoralizing start of this restoration project.

# Positive and Negative, Damage Assessment
This section will be short. In my excitement to get this thing started, I connected the battery backwards. Cue magic battery smoke in an enclosed underground garage, red-hot wires, and me freaking out. I panicked and ripped the battery off of the terminals (which had been halfway screwed in), and looked over the damage. All of the wires coming from the battery were toast, and I knew that I couldn't trust any of the electrical components anymore. I was hoping to god that I hadn't totaled this thing immediately after buying it. 

# Looking for Solutions
## Fixing by Hand
In an effort to salvage the existing harness, I took a look at the wiring diagram online, seen here:

Ok, this is overwhelming, I've barely touched any sort of wiring in my life. I need another solution.

## Replacing the Entire Harness
Luckily, I found some used replacement harnesses online for around $60, and decided to give that a shot. I was not confident in my wiring skills in the slightest, so I figured it was better to play it safe with a factory-wired harness. Here is the harness in question:

This was the clear fix for this issue. At this point, my biggest worry was not being able to put this thing back together. What if I forgot where things went?

I took some time to seriously study the layout of wiring. Where does everything plug into? What does everything do? How is it routed?

After a while, I felt a bit more comfortable. One by one, I unplugged sections of wiring, and immediately plugged in the replacement section of the new harness. This was a long, painful process, but it slowly started to come together. Finally, everything was back together and looked pretty good.

I took the time to hook up the battery *correctly* this time. I must have had some good karma on my side, because everything lit up on the first try! This was not an ideal start to this restoration, but it encouraged me. I had learned something totally new, and ventured into very uncomfortable territory. Still a very long road ahead...
