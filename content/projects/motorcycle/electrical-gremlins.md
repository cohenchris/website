# First Contact with Gremlins

At some point in my restoration journey, I'd finally got everything in reasonable working order.
At last, I could ride around consistently, reaping the benefits of months of hard work.

However, there was one particularly lingering nasty issue - sometimes, the bike would totally shut off as I was riding.
No throttle response, no spark, no lights, no power at all to any of the components.
Stranded, I would do my best to safely coast to the shoulder.
In most situations, I would try to start it again after a few minutes, and it would roar right back to life without issue.
Some other times, I had to call my roommate, who would come deliver my spare battery.

This terrified me - intermittent electrical issues are commonly referred to as "gremlins".
They're difficult to diagnose and seem to occur randomly.

Here is one of the few times I was stranded on the side of a busy road:

My gut steered me towards the battery.
I'd seen something like this before on my car - while I was gone for an extended 2-month trip, my roommate left a light on in my car and let it sit.
When I returned, my battery was completely drained.
No lights, no engine, I couldn't even unlock the car with my key fob.

I fully charged the battery, but it was never the same.
Sometimes it would start without issue, and sometimes it would try to crank without success.
These symptoms can easily be confused with an alternator issue...
A faulty alternator may manifest as dim/flickering lights, engine misfiring, other strange noises from the engine, or at worst, a car which will not start at all.

## A Crash-Course on Electricity
First, some background:

In order for a vehicle to start, the starter will engage, drawing power from the battery, and turn over the engine. 
Simutaneously, the ignition system (also powered by the battery) generates the spark required to ignite the air-fuel mixture present in the engine's cylinders, starting the combustion process.

After start-up, the **alternator** will take over as the primary source of electrical power.
From here on out, the battery acts as a buffer, storing excess power generated by the alternator (charging), and providing power when more is needed.

The alternator has 2 components - the rotor and stator.
As the engine runs, it spins the magnetic rotor inside of the stator, generating **alternating current (AC)** through electromagnetic induction.

However, all of the electrical components, including the battery, run off of **direct current (DC)**.
A **voltage rectifier** is used to convert the alternator's alternating current into direct current.

A **voltage regulator** is responsible for keeping the alternator's power within a constant and safe voltage range, typically around 14 volts while running.
If a regulator were not present, the alternator could overcharge the battery or damage other electrical components.

Side note - rectifiers/regulators are often separate units on older vehicles.
Newer vehicles combine these into one unit. The original system on my bike is separated - in this photo, the regulator is on the left, and the rectifier is on the right:

## Searching for Solutions

A bad battery may show the same/similar symptoms as a bad alternator.
Alternators do not often fail, so more often than not, a battery replacement will fix everything (this was the case with my car).
My motorcycle threw me for a loop - whenever the bike shut off suddenly, replacing the battery would fix it.
I was convinced that one of my batteries had gone bad.

However, the issue kept happening.
If a bad battery were the culprit, the issue would have gone away after replacement.
However, it seemed like the act of swapping the batteries, **not** swapping in a specific battery, would fix the issue.

Day by day, as this issue kept popping up, I convinced myself that I must have a bad alternator.
NOS (new old stock) alternators are impossible to find, and there are not many used replacements online.
Even if I were to find a used replacement, the integrity of the unit is not guaranteed.
What's worse, the labor for replacement would not be easy.


# Two steps forward, one step back

## Finding the Issue
At some point, the issue happened again on the road.
I pulled over, called my roommate to bring me a battery, and waited.
Once he showed up, I started to swap out the batteries.
All of a sudden, the negative battery terminal totally disconnected and fell into my hand.

Everything clicked.

Early on in this restoration project, I may have accidentally set fire to the original harness (I wrote a fun article on this!), so I ordered a replacement harness from eBay.
On this used harness, the battery terminals had been snipped off.
Easy fix, I just went to Home Depot, grabbed some new battery terminals, crimped them onto the harness, and forgot about it.
This was somehow the first time I had ever crimped wire, and I didn't crimp hard enough.
When riding, the terminal connection could be rattled loose, which would shut off power to the entire bike.

Looking back at my crimping job, it's not surprising that my work didn't last:

Sometimes, the simplest explanation is the right one.

## Predictable Failure
Once I got home, I tried re-crimping everything.
In my infinite genius, I tried tidying up some other wiring nearby and broke something else.
One of the wires connecting the voltage rectifier to the harness had been completely ripped off.

## A Fortunate Third-Party Solution
I started scouring eBay for a replacement rectifier.
Much like the alternator, there were exactly ZERO units for sale which were fully functional.
Many were either pulled off of junk bikes and in terrible condition, or wires were also ripped off, same as mine.
The piece which broke off was *not* trivial to fix - the wire was riveted to the body of the rectifier, and I had no idea what the proper procedure would be to reliably fix this.

I sulked for a few days, then went searching through old forums for possible solutions.
Fortunately, I came across a thread which suggested a brand new [third-party combination rectifier/regulator](https://ricksmotorsportelectrics.com/l/rectifier-regulators), and it was made exactly for my bike!
Even better, this unit was a plug-and-play replacement, meaning that no further error-prone crimping and cutting was required.

It was a bit expensive at $125, but I had no other option.
Once I received it in the mail, it took me all of 30 minutes to replace it, and the bike started right up!
A brand new unit meant better peace of mind.
I was happy.

Moral of the story - if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

Learn from my mistakes :)
