In August 2022, I bought a motorcycle.

It was a little more than an impulse buy. I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. I had never worked on anything mechanical in my entire life, let alone attempting to restore an entire motorcycle.

I got hooked on motorcycles when I learned to ride one at a friend's house. I started looking around on Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace, hoping for something under $3k. I found plenty of examples, usually around 250CC, and almost all carbureted. About a week after I started looking, this old 1976 Kawasaki popped up on my feed, and I fell in love with it. I visited the seller, and was saw that it hadn't been registered since 1994, nearly 20 years. It absolutely needed work, but it ran, and I couldn't get it out of my head. It was listed for $1900, and I haggled it down to $1500 with free delivery.

Delivery day came, and again, he started it in front of me. I paid him, he left, and I went back inside to finish work for the day. At the end of the day, I tried starting it again. No luck. I spent about 30 minutes trying to start it. I didn't even know which direction to set the choke lever, let alone ride the thing. I called the seller, asking how he got it started, but he never responded. Red flag #1...

I admitted defeat, and walked the bike down the ramp of my complex's underground garage.

Shortly after, I bought a full shop manual on eBay, and would come to know every single page. This was the beginning of a very, very long journey. Over a year later, it's still not quite over, and I've endured much more time, pain, and money than I expected, but I wouldn't change a thing. I've learned far more than I ever expected to, and have come to really appreciate the sheer feats of engineering from the 1970s.
