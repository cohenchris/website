# Hi, I'm Chris Cohen.

I graduated from Purdue University in May 2021 with a B.S. in Computer Science, emphasizing software engineering and computer security.
At the moment, I work for Qualcomm in San Diego, CA as a senior software security engineer.

Professionally, I tend to work with low-level projects, primarily using C, C++, and x86 Assembly.
At Qualcomm, I've been the primary developer for our ROM-backed implementation of the [open DICE standard](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/work-groups/dice-architectures/).
At a high level, DICE provides a device-unique verifiable certificate chain which is generated on each boot.
This may be used to support a wide variety of features, including:

- Remote device provisioning
- Remote device attestation
- Secure video playback

This project was started from scratch, is currently present in ROM on the Qualcomm Snapdragon SM8650 and beyond, including various mobile, automotive, and IoT Qualcomm targets.

Outside of work, I like to surf and play the cello.
I also typically juggle some random project as a pastime - right now, I'm restoring a 1976 Kawasaki KZ400-S2.
It was an impulse buy, and I knew absolutely nothing at the beginning, so YouTube has been my savior.
I post about this pretty often, so check out my Projects page!

As for tech-related projects, I maintain a server rack at my home.
I use this to learn about networking, host privacy-focused services for personal use, tinker with new hardware/software, and much more.
This started as a COVID hobby, but has evolved into a full 9u server rack and complex network configuration.
I also post about this every now and then.
